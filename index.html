                leveraging my skills to create meaningful experiences and uncover valuable insights from data. From crafting captivating logos to developing innovative

                By combining my artistic flair with analytic thinking, I have the unique ability to breathe life into data-driven narratives, effectively communicating complex

            <h3>Graphic Designer</h3>
            <p>I discovered my passion for graphic design back in 2015, and over the years, my artistic journey has been nothing short of exhilarating. Initially, my designs were appreciated
                 for their simplicity and captivating appeal, but as I continued to grow and evolve as an artist, I found myself irresistibly drawn to the realm of geometric designs, exploring
                 the creative possibilities of negative space, and drawing inspiration from the vibrant and expressive styles of the 70s.</p>

                <img class="gd-img1" src="images/ntpin2016.png" > 

                

                 <p>The years 2016 and 2017 marked significant milestones in my graphic design career. During this time, I actively participated in <a id="skillsusa" href="http://baccwhite.weebly.com/skillsusa.html" target="blank">SkillsUSA</a> both state and national competitions. My dedication
                 and hard work culminated in the creation and presentation of a remarkable t-shirt and pin design, each reflecting the essence of my home state, Arizona. I was incredibly honored to have 
                 achieved 4th place nationally for my outstanding pin design in 2016, and my proudest moment <img class="gd-img2" src="images/ntshirt2017.png" alt="gd art"> came in 2017 when my innovative t-shirt design claimed the prestigious 1st place position. </p>
                <br><br> 
              
                <p>Presently, my passion for graphic design continues to thrive. I derive immense joy from crafting unique and eye-catching logos for small businesses, as well as exploring various creative
                 avenues to bring intriguing t-shirt ideas to life. Through my art, I find a powerful medium of self-expression, allowing me to communicate my thoughts, emotions, and inspirations to the world. </p>
                <br><br>  
                
                <p>As I look towards the future, I am eager to further push the boundaries of my creativity, embracing new challenges and opportunities that come my way. With each project, I strive to infuse my
                 work with a distinctive touch that captivates audiences and leaves a lasting impression. Graphic design is not just a career for me; it's an artistic journey that keeps evolving, and I am excited 
                 to see where it takes me next</p>

            <h3>Data Scientist</h3>
            <p>During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of attending a captivating 6pm lecture titled "Statistical Foundations in the Information Age." Little did I know that this course would spark a 
                profound admiration for the world of data - its intricate structure and its remarkable manipulative power. As the weeks progressed, I found myself falling head over heels in love with the enchanting 
                realm of data structures, algorithms, and the ever-evolving symbiosis between humans and data.
                <br><br>

                Currently, I am dedicated to honing my data science skills by pursuing a master's degree at the University of Arizona. This journey is a testament to my unwavering commitment to personal growth and my passion for unraveling 
                the complexities of data.
